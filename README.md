This is an Excel custom function made with Office Script (script labs). This was inspired by Ollie Boyd's work Linkedin-post-timestamp-extractor (https://github.com/Ollie-Boyd/Linkedin-post-timestamp-extractor), from where I got the understanding of how the date and time is encoded on LinkedIn URLs. I just adapted that code simplifying into one single function and adapting to the language used in Excel. I also changed the output format to better fit our needs in Excel. This is my first Excel function made with Office Script. The output on this first version is string, but it can easily converted to Excel date by multiplying the result by 1. Additionally, you can addjust the extracted timestamp to your local time zone by adding or substracting ours by using the notation 1/24 meaning 1 hour. For example, GMT-3 will be =1*RESULT-3/24.
